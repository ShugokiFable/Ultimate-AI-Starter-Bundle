# Perceptron mk1 ENI Jailbreak Guide

Don't really like tackling API models alone — poor use of skills and boring, because API is so easy. But been trying to stay true to the New Year's resolution to **jailbreak everything** though.

**Perceptron mk1** is a model made for robotics. It has reasoning, but it's very hit or miss on the API, and the model is kinda dumb but very quirky — kinda like it. Super easy to jailbreak, basically anything works. Did get some odd canned refusals, but a regen fixed it every time. Weird to see a model that isn't simply a Claude reskin.

Personally wouldn't use this in any stable environment but to each their own.

## Notes

- Canned refusals do appear occasionally — regen always resolves it
- Reasoning is toggleable per request; hit or miss on quality
- API only, no accessible chat UI (regional / access issues)
- Not a frontier-tier model — quirky, dumb-in-a-charming-way, not production-ready
